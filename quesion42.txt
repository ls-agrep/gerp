Unix code
Ls is list
•	ls -S sorts the files in order by size (note: options are case-sensitive so this is a capital S)
•	ls -l shows the long format list of the files including size and file permissions (which is handy to know for security reasons)
•	ls -lh shows long format with units for file size (eg K for kilobytes, M for megabytes etc) to make it easily readable by a user (human-readable)
ls -a shows hidden files 
cd .. go back to previous directory 
cd (dirname) go into dir
cat tell whats in text file
cat (filename) 
ssh thingname@ownersname
For example, if you want to create a file of good cat and echo jokes, you can use the command:
echo "Why are cats so good at video games?" > unix-jokes.txt
echo adljsdh displays that
When we want to append more text onto the end of our file we use two greater than signs >> instead of only one.
Exit leave 
cat --\ if file has weird name 
You simply use cat followed by the filenames you want to join together and then use the > to redirect the contents of the files into a new file.
cat file1.txt file2.txt > new-file.txt
To view the Unix root directory using the Bash terminal you can use the command ls /
ls -F for / after file
To move back two directories we add another two dots and a /
cd ../../
grep is a command-line utility that allows you to search for specific patterns in text or files. It stands for Global Regular Expression Print.
grep [options] pattern [files] 
•	-i: ignore case when searching
•	-v: invert the search and show lines that do not match the pattern
•	-c: count the number of lines that match the pattern

The wc command is often used to count occurrences in a file.
•	wc -l [file] - returns the number of lines in a file.
•	wc -w [file] - returns the number of words in a file.
Don't forget that you can type wc --help in the editor below, to find some other options you can use with wc.
-c, --bytes            
  -m, --chars            
  -l, --lines
Grep 
 -i case insensitive 
Searches all things 
 -r (thing) . 
To unzip file 
File.gz
Pipe (|) makes previous output as next instructions input
Sometimes multiple occurrences of a pattern can be found on the same line. To output all occurrences of a pattern use the -o option

•	sort - sorts the file in ascending order.
•	uniq - outputs each unique animal once.
•	sort -r - will sort the output in reverse order r.
•	head allows you to see the top lines of a specified output. For example head -1 will show the top line and head -2 the top two.
•	tail could also be used to display the bottom lines of a file.
ls | grep budget  	files with grep budget 
ls | grep -E '.pdf|.txt' 		output those of either
The asterisk (*) represents zero or more characters of any type. For example, the wildcard *.pdf would match any file that has a name ending in .pdf,
grep  b*ber  playlist.txt

cd dirpath (short for change directory) ● change folder cat filename Read the contents of a file 
cat >> filename (short for concatenate) create a new file or append content to existing file 
mv oldname newname Rename a file cp filename newfile Copy and paste 
mv oldname  ./dirname copy and paste
rm filename Delete a file 
mkdir dirname Create a new directory 
rmdir dirname Delete an empty directory

sudo (command) is run as admin
